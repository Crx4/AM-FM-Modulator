        Amplitude modulation (AM) is a modulation technique used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave. In amplitude modulation, the amplitude (signal strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the waveform being transmitted.\n
        \n
        c(t) = A . sin( 2.π.fc.t)\n
        m(t) = M . cos( 2.π.fm.t + φ)\n
        y(t) = [1 + m(t)] . c(t)\n
        \n
        Angle modulation is a class of analog modulation. These techniques are based on altering the angle (or phase) of a carrier signal to transmit data. This as opposed to varying the amplitude of the carrier, such as in amplitude modulation transmission.\n
        \n
        s(t) = A . cos( 2.π.fc.t + φ(t) )\n
        PM: φ(t) = np . m(t), where np is parameter called phase modulation index.\n
        FM: φ’(t) = nf . m(t), where nf is the frequency modulation index and φ’(t).
