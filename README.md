# AM-FM-Modulator
An Android App that plots graphs of Analog to Analog Signal Waves

AM-FM Modulator is a wave modulator and graph sketcher. There is a model signal whic can called either data or modulating signal and also the carrier signal. You can set the values of signal like Amplitude, Frequency, Phase and the interval of time that graph will show.

Application make samples of points in two dimentional space and plot the graph. Samples depends the time interval that you set. Each time unit has one hundred sample point for the graph. After data prepared user can see four different graph: Modulating Wave Graph, Carrier Wave Graph, Modulated Wave Graph and a Multi Waves Graph that shows Modulating and Modulated Waves.

This app using "GraphView - open source graph plotting library for Android".  Please feel free to make pull requests, if there's anything you feel we could do better!
