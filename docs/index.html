                <p>
                    AM-FM Modulator is a wave modulator and graph sketcher. There is a model signal
                    whic can called either data or modulating signal and also the carrier signal.
                    You can set the values of signal like Amplitude, Frequency, Phase and the
                    interval of time that graph will show.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application make samples of points in two dimentional space and plot the graph.
                    Samples depends the time interval that you set. Each time unit has one hundred
                    sample point for the graph. After data prepared user can see four different
                    graph: Modulating Wave Graph, Carrier Wave Graph, Modulated Wave Graph and a
                    Multi Waves Graph that shows Modulating and Modulated Waves.

                <p>
                    Amplitude modulation (AM) is a modulation technique used in electronic
                    communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio carrier
                    wave. In amplitude modulation, the amplitude (signal strength) of the carrier
                    wave is varied in proportion to the waveform being transmitted.

                    <strong>Formulas:</strong><br>
                    c(t) = A . sin( 2.π.fc.t) <br>
                    m(t) = M . cos( 2.π.fm.t + φ) <br>
                    y(t) = [1 + m(t)] . c(t) <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Angle modulation is a class of analog modulation. These techniques are based on
                    altering the angle (or phase) of a carrier signal to transmit data. This as
                    opposed to varying the amplitude of the carrier, such as in amplitude modulation
                    transmission.

                    PM: φ(t) = np . m(t), where np is parameter called phase modulation index. <br>
                    FM: φ'(t) = nf . m(t), where nf is the frequency modulation index and φ’(t).
